## Overview

SCLoadForecasting analyzes historical weather data—temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation—to predict power load on an hourly basis. This information is valuable for energy providers to balance supply with demand, reduce costs, and manage resources more efficiently.

### Key Features
- **Hourly Load Forecasting**: Predicts energy usage for each hour based on past weather data.
- **Comprehensive Weather Integration**: Uses weather variables like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed as predictors.
- **Easy Data Handling**: Processes data in CSV format for straightforward manipulation and model evaluation.
